      <h2>Call for Papers and Notes</h2>
      
      <div class="notice">
        Call for Papers and Notes - Ubicomp 2012 - Pittsburgh, PA - Sept 5-8 2012 - Due Date March 2
      </div>
      
      <p>
        Ubicomp 2012 welcomes original, high-quality research contributions 
        that advance the state of the art in the design, development, deployment, evaluation 
        and understanding of ubiquitous computing systems and their applications. 
        Ubicomp is an interdisciplinary field that includes technologies 
        that bridge the digital and physical worlds, systems and applications 
        that incorporate such technologies, infrastructures that support them, 
        human activities and experiences these technologies facilitate, 
        and conceptual overviews that help us understand&mdash;or challenge our understanding of&mdash; 
        the impact of these technologies.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The Ubicomp conference is a premier international venue 
        in which novel results in these areas are presented and discussed 
        among leading researchers, designers, developers and practitioners in this field. 
        Questions about this call can be directed to Gillian Hayes and Hao-Hua Chu 
        via <a href="mailto:pcchairs2012@ubicomp.org">pcchairs2012@ubicomp.org</a>.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Topics</h3>

      <p>
        Relevant topic areas for full papers and notes include, but are not limited to:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><b>Devices &amp; techniques:</b> descriptions of the design, architecture, usage and evaluation of devices and techniques that create valuable new capabilities for ubiquitous computing</li>
        <li><b>Systems &amp; infrastructures:</b> descriptions of the design, architecture, deployment and evaluation of systems and infrastructures that support ubiquitous computing</li>
        <li><b>Applications:</b> descriptions of the design and/or study of applications that leverage Ubicomp devices and systems</li>
        <li><b>Methodologies &amp; tools:</b> new methods and tools applied to studying or building Ubicomp systems and applications</li>
        <li><b>Theories &amp; models:</b> critical analysis or organizing theory with clear relevance to the design or study of Ubicomp systems</li>
        <li><b>Experiences:</b> empirical investigations of the use of new or existing Ubicomp technologies with clear relevance to the design and deployment of future Ubicomp systems</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        Ubicomp 2012 encourages full papers and notes that reflect the breadth and scope of Ubicomp research, including conceptual development, empirical investigations, technological advances, user experiences, and more. All papers (Full Papers and Notes) should clearly compare and contrast how the work relates to previous research or experience, what aspects of the work are new, and the major contributions it makes. Although it is expected that papers will focus on one or a small number of the aforementioned areas, authors should write for the broader Ubicomp audience, and make clear how the work contributes to the Ubicomp field as a whole.
      </p>

      <h3>Full Papers or Notes</h3>

      <p>
        Full Papers (10-page submissions) and Notes (4-page submissions that are not works in progress) are due at the same time and will be reviewed by the same committee using the same review process to ensure a uniform quality between Full Papers and Notes. Both will be evaluated on the basis of originality, significance of the contribution to the field, quality of research, quality of writing, and technical correctness. We strongly recommend that authors carefully consider whether their submission should be a Full Paper or a Note. Guidelines for deciding whether your submission should be a Full Paper or Note are described below.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        A Full Paper must break new ground and provide substantial support for its results and conclusions as a significant contribution to the field. Successful submissions typically represent a major advance for the field of ubiquitous computing. As such, Full Papers should include a thorough survey of related work; a comprehensive, detailed and understandable explanation of a device, system, study, theory or method; and a compelling validation of the work. Accepted Full Papers will be allocated longer presentation time slots at the conference than accepted Notes. Full Papers must be no longer than 10 pages, including the abstract (no more than 150 words), all figures and references. Please download and use the required templates to prepare your submission.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        A Note must report new results that provide a novel and valuable contribution to the field. Notes are not "works in progress": they are intended for more succinct work that is nonetheless in a mature state ready for inclusion in archival proceedings. They will be held to the same standard of scientific quality as Full Papers, albeit for a shorter contribution, and must still state how they fit with respect to related work, and provide a compelling explanation and validation. Notes must be no longer than 4 pages, including the abstract (no more than 150 words), all figures, and references.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        All papers (Full Papers and Notes) should clearly compare and contrast how the work relates to previous research or experience, what aspects of the work are new, and the major contributions it makes.

      </p>
      
      <h3>Formatting and Submission</h3>

      <p>
        Papers and notes should be formatted according to <a href="http://www.ubicomp.org/ubicomp2012/templates.html">the Ubicomp ACM Word or Latex template</a>. Please download and use the required templates to prepare your submission. Submissions must be in PDF format and conform to the guidelines specified in this call. Accepted Full Papers and Notes will be included in the conference proceedings published by ACM Press and included in the ACM Digital Library.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Paper submissions have to be anonymized to facilitate double blind review. Authors should take care throughout their paper that their and their institution's identity is not revealed. However, relevant references to an author's previous research (which may be required for reviewers to understand and evaluate the paper's contribution) should not be suppressed but instead referenced in a neutral way. Submissions should contain no information that will be proprietary or confidential at the time of publication. All paper submissions will be handled electronically by the <a href="https://precisionconference.com/~ubicomp">Precision Conference Support (PCS) system</a>. If you do not already have an account, you will need to create one. The deadline is firm and late submissions will not be accepted, so we encourage you to begin this process early.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Submissions must not have been previously published or be under simultaneous review for any other conference, journal, workshop or other publication with an ISBN, ISSN, or DOI number. Authors with questions about whether previous publications would disqualify a prospective submission are encouraged to contact the Programme Co-Chairs well in advance of the submission deadline.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Multi-Presentation Format</h3>
      
      <p>
        Supplemental materials in the form of demo descriptions, video briefs, or poster sketches can be included to communicate ideas. Lack of such supplemental materials will not result in negative scores. All paper authors are encouraged to consider how they could present their work in an additional format: as a demo, a poster, or through a video of the prototype being used in a real environment. In this way, presenters will get more “participant face-time” while conference attendees will have the opportunity to better understand details of the work in a more interactive setting. The Ubicomp 2012 submission system will allow authors to indicate additional formats in which they would be able to present their work, and to upload supplemental material as needed. Authors of accepted full papers or notes that indicate a multi-presentation format will have their poster, video, and/or demo automatically accepted into the corresponding adjunct program tracks (no need for the 2-page abstract that is otherwise required for regular adjunct program submissions).
      </p>
